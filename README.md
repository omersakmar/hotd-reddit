I enjoy reading about the GoT universe, and with the release of the House of the Dragon, I've been spending quite some time going through some of the most popular subreddits on the topic.

So I've built a simple website using React, Tailwind CSS, SWR, that fetches data from TMDB and Reddit APIs, to display some information about the most recent episodes, and help me route to the subreddits I often follow to see the recent hot posts.

Here's a live demo: https://omersakmar-hotd-reddit.netlify.app/
